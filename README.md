# Exact_diagonalization_spin_half
I will try to construct a many body Hamiltonian and solve it using the basic python modules. For concreteness we will solve two examples, namely the transeverse field Ising (TFI) model and the toric code (TC) model in one and two spatial dimensions respectively.

In the [one dimensional notebook](https://github.com/animeshnanda1/Exact_diagonalization_spin_half/blob/main/exact_diagonalization_1d_tfim.ipynb) I will solve the transeverse filed Ising model. While in the [second notebook](https://github.com/animeshnanda1/Exact_diagonalization_spin_half/blob/main/exact_diagonalization_2d_tcm.ipynb) I will solve the two dimensional toric code model. Rest of the details are given in the notebook itself.
